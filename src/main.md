## Get Started Fast

Choose a service - or combine them together:

### Device Detection

Identify device types, capabilities, and features to optimize experiences across phones, tablets, TVs, and more.

* Start by reading the [Device Detection Overview](@ref DeviceDetection_Overview) to understand how it works and its benefits.
* Follow the [Device Detection Quickstart](@ref DeviceDetection_Quickstart) to add it to your application.
* Learn how to detect Apple models with [Apple Device Detection](@ref DeviceDetection_Features_AppleDetection) using client-side JavaScript.

### IP Intelligence

Gain insights into user locations and IP addresses for targeted content, analytics, and fraud prevention.

* Read the [IP Intelligence Overview](@ref IpIntelligence_Overview) to learn about our IP intelligence capabilities.
* Follow the [IP Intelligence Quickstart](@ref IpIntelligence_Quickstart) to integrate IP intelligence into your application.

### Reverse Geocoding

Obtain accurate real-world location data from coordinates, such as postal addresses, using our Reverse Geocoding service.

* Learn how it works in the [Reverse Geocoding Overview](@ref ReverseGeocoding_Overview).
* Follow the [Reverse Geocoding Quickstart](@ref ReverseGeocoding_Quickstart) to implement reverse geocoding in your application.

### Client-side JavaScript

If you're working entirely in the browser, you can use 51Degrees without server-side code.

Use the <a href="https://configure.51degrees.com/" target="_blank">Cloud Configurator</a>
to select the properties you want
and generate a custom JavaScript snippet to embed in your page.

See the @configuratorexplanation for instructions on how to obtain a Resource Key and use it with the generated snippet.
