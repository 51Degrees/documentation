# Introduction

**Cloud engines** are a specialization of @aspectengine where additional data exists on a cloud
service and is accessed by the **engine**. This is in contrast to an @onpremiseengine where data
exists locally to the **engine**. Having data which does not reside in the **engine** itself
means that the same **engine** can be used with multiple data sets.


**TODO what can be said about a cloud engine? there's not much there.**
