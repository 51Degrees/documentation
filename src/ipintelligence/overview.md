# Introduction

**IP Intelligence** provides geolocation, ISP, connection type, and network information for any IP address to enhance user experience, security, and content delivery.

## How it works

51Degrees uses a patent-applied algorithm to identify IP network ranges and locations. The engine returns:
- **Network data:** ISP, organization, connection type
- **Location data:** Country, region, city with probability weighting
- **Ultra-low latency:** Sub-microsecond detection time with in-process deployment
- **Performance-critical ready:** Ideal for real-time servers, edge/load balancers, and high-load scenarios
- **Deployment flexibility:** In-process by default, with optional out-of-process or separate server deployment

Features include [randomized coordinates](@ref IpIntelligence_Features_Randomization) for privacy and [multiple result weighting](@ref IpIntelligence_Features_Weighting) for accuracy.

See [technical specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/ip-intelligence-specification/README.md) for details.
