# Upgrading to 51Degrees Version 4

This guide details how current Version 3 customers of 51Degrees can upgrade to Version 4.

Version 4 is faster, has a smaller data file, and has an upgraded algorithm that allows better detection of new, different, and rare User-Agents.
Additionally, Version 4 has support for [Google's changes to the User-Agent](https://learnclienthints.com/) and the new 
[User-Agent Client Hints](https://51degrees.com/blog/updates-to-user-agent-client-hints-version-4-4) HTTP request header.

The steps to upgrade will vary depending on whether you are using our cloud or on-premise service.

## V3 Cloud users <a href="#V3_Cloud">#</a> @anchor V3_Cloud

Use our [Cloud Configurator](https://configure.51degrees.com/) to generate a new Resource Key. You can follow our 
@configuratorexplanation for a step by step guide. This Resource Key should contain all the properties you wish to collect data for â€“ 
you can find a list of all the available properties on our [property dictionary](https://51degrees.com/developers/property-dictionary). 
Some advanced properties may require the purchase of a License Key. Sign up to one of our [pricing plans](https://51degrees.com/pricing) 
to be granted a License Key.

If you are looking for User-Agent Client Hints support in the cloud, please follow the [User-Agent Client Hints documentation](@ref DeviceDetection_Features_UACH_Overview).

## V3 On-premise users <a href="#V3_On_Prem">#</a> @anchor V3_On_Prem

If you wish to continue to use 51Degrees on-premise, you will need to purchase a License Key to access the Version 4 data files. Visit our [pricing](https://51degrees.com/pricing) page and
select the suitable plan for your needs. Alternatively, you may wish to use our [cloud service](@ref V3_Cloud), which can be called from the server via our APIs.

Once you have received a License Key after signing up for a pricing plan, you can use the key to download a data file for on-premise implementations that contains all the properties. You can 
[download the file manually](https://51degrees.com/developers/downloads) or set up [automatic data file updates](@ref Features_AutomaticDatafileUpdates).

You can download the latest API packages for your programming language via our [downloads page](https://51degrees.com/developers/downloads)
or [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees).

Once you have obtained your new License Key and downloaded the latest API packages and data file, please visit our 
[Migration guide](@ref DeviceDetection_MigrationGuides_51DegreesV3) for the next steps.

We also recommend enabling @usagesharing in your environment. This allows our machine learning algorithm to grow and therefore detect new and unique User-Agents quicker with 
higher levels of accuracy.

If you are looking for User-Agent Client Hints support, please follow the [User-Agent Client Hints documentation](@ref DeviceDetection_Features_UACH_Overview).
