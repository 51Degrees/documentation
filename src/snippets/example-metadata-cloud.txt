This example shows how to retrieve property metadata from the 51Degrees 
cloud service. 
This feature can be used to get information such as the category that 
a property belongs to or the possible values a property can have. 
(At the time of the request. If the data file being used by the cloud 
service is updated, the possible values for a property can change)
