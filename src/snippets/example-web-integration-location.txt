This example demonstrates how to get location information from the device
that a user is using to access a website. 
In addition, JavaScript is used to update the page with postal address details 
for this location.

This works by using the <a href="http://www.51degrees.com/documentation/4.1/_features__client_side_evidence.html">client-side evidence</a> 
feature of the Pipeline.
Briefly, properties containing JavaScript snippets are populated by engines 
in the Pipeline and these are then bundled together into a single JavaScript 
block by the 'JsonBuilder' and 'JavaScriptBuilder' elements.
This JavaScript is then used to obtain the additional evidence from the 
client (in this case, latitude and longitude) and pass it back to the server. 
The Pipeline running on the server then processes this evidence to 
populate a new JSON result object that is returned to the client.
