This example shows how to change the performance profile when creating 
a 51Degrees device detection engine.
It also includes a simple method of benchmarking the engine that
can illustrate the performance differences.
Note that benchmarking is a complex area and this is not a sophisticated 
solution. It is simply intended to demonstrate the approximate, relative 
performance of the pre-configured profiles.
