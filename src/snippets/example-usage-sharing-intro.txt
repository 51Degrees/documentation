This Example shows how to configure the usage sharing feature of 
the Pipeline API. Usage sharing is a feature that allows you to share details 
of the requests you are processing with 51Degrees.
</p>
<p>
Usage sharing works by adding a 'ShareUsageElement' to the pipeline.
This element will collect evidence values as they pass through, 
periodically sending them to 51Degrees for processing.
<p>
If you want to know more about usage sharing, and why you should 
consider using it, see the usage sharing
