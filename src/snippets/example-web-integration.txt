This example shows how to use 51Degrees On-premise device detection in a web context to determine 
details about a device based on its User-Agent and User-Agent Client Hint HTTP header values.
</p>
<p>
We demonstrate how to use the
<a href="http://51degrees.com/documentation/_features__web_integration.html">web integration</a> 
feature to:
<ul>
  <li>Pass the required information from the web context to the pipeline API.</li>
  <li>Populate relevant response headers such as Accept-CH for User-Agent Client Hints</li>
  <li>Acquire and process evidence from client-side JavaScript. This is used to determine 
  iPhone / iPad models.</li>
</ul>
