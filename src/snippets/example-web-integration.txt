This example demonstrates how to enhance results by incorporating evidence 
from client-side JavaScript.
This approach is required to perform certain tasks such as identify iPhone 
and iPad models or get the screen resolution for a desktop device.

<p>
Properties containing JavaScript snippets are populated by engines in the 
Pipeline and these are then bundled together into a single JavaScript 
block by the 'JsonBuilder' and 'JavaScriptBuilder' elements.
This JavaScript is then used to obtain the additional evidence from the 
client and pass it back to the server. The updated results can then be 
used immediately on the client-side or on subsequent requests to the server.
