This example requires a local data file. The free 'Lite' data file can be acquired by
pulling the git submodules under this repository (run `git submodule update --recursive`) 
or from the <a href="https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-data">device-detection-data</a>
GitHub repository.

The Lite data file is only used for illustration, and has limited accuracy and capabilities.
