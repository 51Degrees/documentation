# Introduction

User-Agent Client Hints (UACH) are part of a Google proposal to replace the 
existing User-Agent HTTP header.

For more details on what User-Agent Client Hints are and how they work,
see the Background section below. If you just want to know how to
work with them using the 51Degrees API then read on.

# Support for detection from Client Hints

The 51Degrees device detection API has provided support for detection 
based on one of the client hints headers (Sec-CH-UA only) in data files 
from 7th December 2020.

This limited support was superseded by functionality in version 4.3
on the API and data files from [TODO - DATE], which allows detection based 
on all the client hints headers.

Note that older API versions prior to 4.3 can use the newer data files and 
version 4.3+ can use the older data files. However, in order to detect
devices using UACH, you must be using BOTH version 4.3+ of the API and 
a newer data file.

# Detection

Previously, device detection worked primarily by examining the 
value of the User-Agent HTTP header. This header is always sent as part 
of the first request to a webserver, meaning device information was 
available immediately on the server-side.

With UACH, only a limited subset of information is sent as part of the 
first request.
If the server wishes to know more, then it needs to set an HTTP header in
the response to request the additional detail.

The 51Degrees API will automatically determine the names and values of
any response headers that need to be set based on the initial information.

In using the Pipeline API with web integration, some languages will
automatically set the response headers for you as well.
If not using a web integration, or your language does not support it, 
you will need to set the response headers manually.

[Examples](@ref Examples_DeviceDetection_UserAgentClientHints_Examples) 
are available covering applicable scenarios for all supported languages.

## Cloud

Using UACH for device detection with our cloud product is usually simple.
However, there are some scenarios that cause additional complexity.

### Calling from Pipeline API

If you are calling the cloud from a Pipeline API then you simply need 
to ensure that the appropriate response headers are set and that the 
UACH headers are then included in the request to cloud.

TODO: Will users need to get a new resource key in order to have access
to the SetHeader* properties?

The Pipeline API will handle this for you for the most part. There are 
[examples](@ref Examples_DeviceDetection_UserAgentClientHints_Examples) 
available to show what changes you need to make for your language.

### Calling from (non-Pipeline API) server-side code.

As above, in order to use UACH, you'll just need to ensure that the 
appropriate response headers are set and that the UACH headers are 
then included in the request to cloud.

TODO: Will users need to get a new resource key in order to have access
to the SetHeader* properties?

Exactly what this looks like will vary by language, but there are 
2 essential steps.

1. The relevant response headers must be set after a first request. Currently, this is the Accept-CH header for UACH. The 'SetHeader*' properties will provide a list of the values that need to be set on response headers in order to request the relevant UACH headers. 
2. The call to cloud must be modified to include the UACH header values you are interested in. For example: `https://cloud.51degrees.com/api/v4/RESOURCEKEY.json?user-agent=UA&sec-ch-ua=HEADERVALUE&sec-ch-ua-model=HEADERVALUE2`

### Calling from client-side code. 

Calling the cloud from client-side code is simpler in some ways, as you 
don't need to worry about setting the Accept-CH header or manually 
including the sec-ch-ua values in the calls to cloud.
However, it does have the additional complication that 
[Client Hints are not sent to third parties by default](https://web.dev/user-agent-client-hints/#hint-scope-and-cross-origin-requests).
To get around this, you will need to include the following values in the 
Feature-Policy header:

sec-ch-ua cloud.51degrees.com;
sec-ch-ua-full-version cloud.51degrees.com;
sec-ch-ua-mobile cloud.51degrees.com;
sec-ch-ua-platform cloud.51degrees.com;
sec-ch-ua-platform-version cloud.51degrees.com;
sec-ch-ua-arch cloud.51degrees.com;
sec-ch-ua-model cloud.51degrees.com;

TODO: Testing is needed to confirm if these values are correct.

# Background

The authors of the proposal have created an [article](https://web.dev/user-agent-client-hints) 
covering how UACH works.
51Degrees has also [blogged](https://51degrees.com/blog/user-agent-client-hints-chrome-89-update) 
[extensively](https://51degrees.com/blog/user-agent-client-hints-update-september-2020) on the subject.

The timeline for deprecation of the User-Agent is currently unclear.
The status of the UACH feature is tracked [here](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5995832180473856).
The best place to get the latest updates appears to be 
[this](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/-2JIRNMWJ7s/m/u-YzXjZ8BAAJ) 
conversation.

User-Agent Client Hints extends the existing Client Hints content 
negotiation feature.

There is documentation of Client Hints on 
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Client_hints) and
from [Google](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/client-hints)

[Caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/client-hints-dpr-width-viewport) indicates 
that support for Client Hints is patchy, while User-Agent Client Hints 
is not yet represented on the site.
