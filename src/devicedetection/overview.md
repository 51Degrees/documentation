@page DeviceDetection_Overview Device Detection Overview

# Introduction

**Device detection** identifies the device, operating system, and browser accessing your website, plus [over 250 other device properties](https://51degrees.com/developers/property-dictionary) to optimize user experience across smartphones, tablets, desktops, TVs, and other connected devices.

## How it works

51Degrees uses a patented [Hash Algorithm](@ref DeviceDetection_Hash) primarily analyzing User-Agent and other HTTP headers. Additional techniques handle modern challenges:

* **Apple devices:** [JavaScript-based detection](@ref DeviceDetection_Features_AppleDetection) overcomes obfuscated User-Agents
* **Modern browsers:** [User-Agent Client Hints](@ref DeviceDetection_Features_UACH_Overview) support for Chromium-based browsers for precise detection and to overcome Google's Android User-Agent reduction  
* **Transcoding browsers:** Detection from alternative headers when User-Agent is modified
* **Enhanced accuracy:** Client-side evidence collection for detailed device identification

See [technical specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/device-detection-specification/README.md) and [features overview](@ref DeviceDetection_Features_Index) for details.

# Common Use Cases

## üé® Responsive Design & User Experience
Detect screen size, device type, and input methods to serve optimal layouts and navigation for different device categories.

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization  
Optimize images, reduce content, and adapt features based on device capabilities and network conditions to improve loading times.

## üìä Analytics & Business Intelligence
Detailed device, OS, and browser analytics to understand user behavior patterns and make data-driven decisions. Enhance programmatic advertising analytics with [Prebid integration](@ref DeviceDetection_OtherIntegrations_Prebid).

## üéØ Advertising & Monetization
Device-specific ad formats, targeting capabilities, and placement optimization to maximize ad revenue. Boost programmatic advertising with [Prebid integration](@ref DeviceDetection_OtherIntegrations_Prebid) for enriched bid requests.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Fraud Detection
Device fingerprinting and behavioral analysis to identify suspicious traffic, bots, and potential security threats.

## üì± Mobile App Development
Progressive Web App detection, feature support identification, and mobile-specific optimizations for native-like experiences.

## üîÑ Cross-Device User Journeys
Device identification and user journey mapping across smartphones, tablets, and desktops for omnichannel experiences.

## üéµ Content Delivery & Media
Codec support detection, screen resolution optimization, and bandwidth-aware delivery for streaming and media platforms.

# Advanced Capabilities

## üçé Apple Device Detection
Apple devices require special handling due to limited User-Agent information. Our [advanced Apple detection](@ref DeviceDetection_Features_AppleDetection) uses client-side JavaScript to identify specific iPhone and iPad models with high accuracy.

## üîç User-Agent Client Hints
Modern browsers are reducing User-Agent information. Stay ahead with our [User-Agent Client Hints support](@ref DeviceDetection_Features_UACH_Overview) for Chromium-based browsers.

## üì± TAC Lookup
Identify mobile device models from IMEI numbers using Type Allocation Code (TAC) lookup. See our [TAC lookup feature](@ref DeviceDetection_Features_TacLookup) for mobile device identification.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Flexible Integration Options
- **Cloud API:** Zero maintenance, always up-to-date, pay-as-you-go
- **On-Premise:** Full control, high performance, enterprise security
- **Hybrid:** Combine both for optimal flexibility

# Technical Foundation

At its core, 51Degrees uses a patented [Hash Algorithm](@ref DeviceDetection_Hash) that delivers:
- **Speed:** Over 1 million detections per second per CPU core
- **Ultra-low latency:** Sub-microsecond detection time with in-process deployment
- **Performance-critical ready:** Ideal for real-time servers, edge/load balancers, and high-load scenarios
- **Accuracy:** Industry-leading detection rates across [250+ device properties](https://51degrees.com/developers/property-dictionary)  
- **Efficiency:** Minimal memory footprint and bandwidth usage
- **Deployment flexibility:** In-process by default, with optional out-of-process or separate server deployment
