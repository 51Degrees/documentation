# Introduction

Device Detection identifies the device, operating system, and browser hitting your website, plus over 250 other details you can use to fine-tune experiences across smartphones, tablets, desktops, TVs, and other connected devices.

## How It Works

At the core of 51Degrees is our patented [Hash Algorithm](@ref DeviceDetection_Hash). It scans the User-Agent and other HTTP headers to identify devices in record time. Want to jump straight to real-world uses? Scroll down to Common use cases. Or stick around to see how we tackle the tougher challenges modern web traffic throws our way.

- **Apple devices:** We use JavaScript detection to see through Apple's hidden User-Agents and spot specific iPhone/iPad models.
- **Modern browsers:** We support [User-Agent Client Hints](@ref DeviceDetection_Features_UACH_Overview) from Chromium browsers to keep detection accurate, even as Google reduces Android User-Agent details.
- **Transcoding browsers:** We detect devices using alternative headers when the User-Agent gets rewritten or stripped out.
- **Enhanced accuracy:** We can gather client-side evidence for deeper device insights.

## Advanced Capabilities

### Apple Device Detection

Apple makes device detection tricky by hiding User-Agent details. We bypass that with client-side JavaScript to identify specific iPhone/iPad models with precision.

### User-Agent Client Hints

Browsers like Chrome are cutting down User-Agent info. Our Client Hints support ensures you stay ahead and maintain accurate detection.

### TAC Lookup

Need to identify a mobile device from its IMEI number? Our Type Allocation Code (TAC) lookup has you covered.

## Flexible Integration Options

Choose what fits your stack:

- **Cloud API:** No infrastructure headaches, always updated, pay-as-you-go.
- **On-Premise:** Maximum control, lightning speed, enterprise security.
- **Hybrid:** The best of both worlds.

## Technical Foundation

Our patented [Hash Algorithm](@ref DeviceDetection_Hash) is built for performance and scale:

- **Speed:** Processes over one million detections per second, per CPU core
- **Ultra-low latency:** Delivers sub-microsecond detection times with in-process deployment
- **Performance-critical ready:** Perfect for high-load servers, edge environments, and real-time systems
- **Accuracy:** Maintains industry-leading accuracy across [250+ device properties](https://51degrees.com/developers/property-dictionary)
- **Efficiency:** Keeps memory and bandwidth usage minimal
- **Deployment flexibility:** Runs in-process by default, or deploys out-of-process or on a separate server if needed
