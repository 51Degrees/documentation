# How Device Detection Works

TODO: some words..

51Degrees have two separate algorithms that can be used to perform device detection, 'Pattern' and 'Hash'. 
These have differently formatted data files and each has it's own strengths and weaknesses.

TODO: Brief comparison

For more detail on exactly how each algorithm works, follow the links below:
