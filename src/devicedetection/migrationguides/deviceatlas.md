# Introduction

Here you'll find a list of DeviceAtlas properties and their 51Degrees equivalent. 
Details of all available DeviceAtlas properties can be found on their website, whilst the [51Degrees property dictionary](https://51degrees.com/resources/property-dictionary) contains details of all our properties and their possible values.


# Obsolete DeviceAtlas capabilities

DeviceAtlas was launched in 2008 when the web and mobile was very different to now. As such, many of the properties DeviceAtlas list have not proven relevant to businesses who've migrated to 51Degrees. 
Examples of these include properties related to J2ME which has been surpassed by platforms like Android, iOS, and Windows Phone, legacy data delivery mechanisms that are no longer in use, or markup specifications that are no longer popular.

Such capabilities are considered obsolete and for reference are listed at the bottom of this page.

Skip to the list of [obsolete capabilities](@ref DeviceDetection_MigrationGuides_DeviceAtlas_Obsolete).
