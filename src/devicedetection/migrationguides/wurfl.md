# Introduction

Here you'll find a list of ScientiaMobile's WURFL properties and values and the 51Degrees equivalents that they map to.

Details of all available WURFL Capabilities can be found on ScientiaMobile's website, whilst the [51Degrees property dictionary](https://51degrees.com/resources/property-dictionary) contains details of all our properties and their possible values.

# Obsolete WURFL capabilities

WURFL was designed in 2001 when the web and mobile were very different to now. As such, the majority of the capabilities WURFL contains have not proven relevant to businesses who've migrated to 51Degrees. 

Examples of these include:
* Capabilities related to iMode which have been replaced by modern smartphones.
* Manufacturer specific capabilities that are no longer significant (Siemens, Sagem, Nokia, etc).
* Media formats that are no longer used.
* Specific J2ME platform information which has been surpassed by platforms like Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.
* Markup specifications that are no longer considered relevant such as WML, XHTML and CHTML.

Such capabilities are considered obsolete and for reference are listed at the bottom of this page.

# Mapped WURFL capabilities

The following table lists the WURFL capability name and 51Degrees properties and values that contain the equivalent data.
