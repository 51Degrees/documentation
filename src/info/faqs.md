#### Why are my temp files not being cleared when using the .NET Pipeline API?

In .NET core, the finalizer is not called when a program exits as described on [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/destructors). Some engines maintain files in a temporary directory while they are in operation and these can remain if a .NET core application using one of these engines is closed.

To workaround this problem, you can either:
- Use the `SetAutoDisposeElements` setting to ensure elements are disposed when the Pipeline is disposed.
- Explicitly call dispose on all engines before exiting the program.
