@page Info_VersionSupport Version Support

All APIs are written with a minimum supported language version. Any version above this is theoretically supported, but bleeding edge releases may not be supported. To help determine whether a version is supported, the table below shows the versions which are tested as part of each release, in addition to the minimum target version.

If something is not supported here, and you believe it should be, [contact us](mailto:support@51degrees.com).
