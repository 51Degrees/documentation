@page ReverseGeocoding_Overview ReverseGeocoding - Overview

# Introduction

The Pipeline API can be used to perform [reverse geocoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_geocoding) 
to obtain real-world location details such as country, city or road name from latitude and 
longitude information.

This service is currently only available via a cloud service rather than a local on-premise solution.

The 51Degrees cloud service exposes location data from two different providers:
1. A 51Degrees-hosted solution based on the [Nominatim](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim) 
API and backed by [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data.
2. The [GeoMprint](https://www.digitalelement.com/solutions/geomprint/) product from 
[Digital Element](https://www.digitalelement.com/).

There is a [quickstart](@ref Quickstart_ReverseGeocoding) guide to get you up and running ASAP or you can
browse the more in-depth [examples](@ref Examples_ReverseGeocoding_Index) first.
