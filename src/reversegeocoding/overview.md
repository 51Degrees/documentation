@page ReverseGeocoding_Overview Reverse Geocoding Overview

# Introduction

The Pipeline API can be used to perform [reverse geocoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_geocoding) 
to obtain real-world location details such as country, city, or road name from latitude and 
longitude information.

This service is currently only available via a cloud service rather than a local on-premise solution.

The 51Degrees Cloud service exposes location data from the following provider:
1. A 51Degrees-hosted solution based on the [Nominatim](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim) 
API and backed by [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data.

There is a [quickstart](@ref ReverseGeocoding_Quickstart) guide to get you up and running ASAP or you can
browse the more in-depth [examples](@ref ReverseGeocoding_Examples_Index) first.
