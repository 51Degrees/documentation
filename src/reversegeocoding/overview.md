## How It Works


You provide coordinates, we return location details like:

- **Country and region** - Know exactly where your users are
- **Cities and neighborhoods** - Get local context for personalization
- **Street addresses** - Turn coordinates into human-readable locations
- **Points of interest** - Identify nearby landmarks and businesses

## Cloud Service


Reverse geocoding runs as a Cloud Service, so there's no local setup needed. We use high-quality location data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) through our [Nominatim](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim)-based solution.
