@page Quickstart_Quickstart Quick Start Guide

# Introduction

This guide aims to give you everything you need to get up and running with whatever services 
you need as soon as possible.

# Server-side and off-line processing

We have examples for each of the languages supported and services provided
by the @Pipeline to help get you started.
If you want to use multiple services then work through the quick start guides 
below and then see the @combiningservices example.

- Quick Start for [Device Detection](@ref Quickstart_DeviceDetection)
- Quick Start for [Reverse Geocoding](@ref Quickstart_ReverseGeocoding)

# Client-side JavaScript

If you intend to only use client-side JavaScript then you can use the 51Degrees 
[Cloud Configurator](https://configure.51degrees.com/) to select the properties you need and
build a custom JavaScript snippet to include in your web page.

See the @configuratorexplanation for details of how to obtain a Resource Key from the
Configurator, and then copy the client-side code examples from the Configurator, which
have your new key included.
