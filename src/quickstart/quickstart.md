# Introduction

This guide aims to give you everything you need to get up and running with whatever services 
you need as soon as possible.

# Client-Side JavaScript

If you intend to use client-side JavaScript only then you can use the 51Degrees cloud 
[Configurator](https://configure.51degrees.com/) 
to select the properties you need and build a custom JavaScript snippet to include in your
web page.

# Server-Side and Off-line Processing

We have examples for each of the languages supported and services provided
by the @Pipeline to help get you started.
If you want to use multiple services then work through the quick start guides 
below and then see the @combiningservices example.

- [Device Detection](@ref Quickstart_DeviceDetection)
- [ReverseGeocoding](@ref Quickstart_ReverseGeocoding)
- IP Intelligence (Coming soon)
