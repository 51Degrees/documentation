# Introduction

Typically, the 51Degrees approach is to use dynamically generated JavaScript to determine the
model on the client-side and pass this back to the server. Some users are unable or unwilling 
to deploy dynamic JavaScript. In this case 51Degrees have an alternative approach in which 
the required data is gathered using static JavaScript. This is then passed to the server to
determine the Apple model.
